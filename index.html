            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a hard learner and eager to take on different activities, 
                especially in the technology side. 
                It is straight forward for me to problem solve and troubleshoot them with my skills.
                 It is easy for me to identify and modify devices I am given. I have strong knowledge and understanding when it comes to computers. I am strongly focused on technology development. I am looking for new opportunities and challenges in the work industry.</p>

                <h3 style= "color:white;">Mercury Wholesaler, Henderson (2 years)</h3>
                <p>
                    My duties as a Storage Helper had a variety of tasks for me to do, such as moving containers and inspecting the incoming products for any issues and also advertising our products through the company website. I received plenty of orders from customers and then sent it off to them. This job improved my time management skills and helped me become better with my attention to detail skills. I was working long shifts but still found a way to use my personal time on my days off works.
